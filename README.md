# Pokémon TriHard Emerald

This is a source ROM hack based on the Pret disassembly of [**Pokémon Emerald**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).
The goal of the game is to provide TPP a viable means of doing a "Nuzlocke". Because this isn't going to actually be
a Nuzlocke, we're getting as close as possible with the following rules:

1. You can only save when you heal at a Pokémon Center or Heal House. (This is enforced by removing the save button and
the game forcing a save when you heal.)
2. You can only have 6 Pokémon. (The Pokémon Storage System is inaccessable, and used as a "graveyard").
3. When a Pokémon dies, it is removed from the party as soon as possible and placed in the "graveyard".
4. When the player blacks out, the game resets and loads the last save point.

(Nuzlocke catching requirements are ignored entirely.) This game is named "TriHard" Emerald, because that is the emote
people will use when we tell them that we think this is a Nuzlocke.

Since this is my first and probably only time I'll be doing a proper Pokémon ROM hack, I've decided to spice up the run
with some various story changes and playing into the "TriHard" name. Our protagonist is a "TriHard". They'll be chasing
a "TriHard" (Entei) for part of the story. The game will inevitably fail to pull heart strings occasionally, which will
surely be worthy of some "TriHard"s in the chat. 

At the same time, I don't want this to be just a meme run. It should be able to stand on its own and not be tied
inexorably to TPP. A Nuzlocke's whole purpose is to add drama to a familiar game by means of the additional constant 
threat of losing everything at any moment.
